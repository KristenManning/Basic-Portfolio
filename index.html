	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		I recently finished undegrad in Mechanical Engineering and I'm excited to continue building cool stuff at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp! My interests include exercise, arts &amp; crafts, and boardgames. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
		In highschool and college I competed as a varsity rower. Now that I've graduated, I'm hoping to pick up swimming or running. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Recently, I started learning oil painting! I'm always on the lookout for DIY projects or crafts, but I'm trying to hone some more traditional artistic skills, like painting and drawing, as well. 
		</p>

		<p>My favorite boardgames include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Dominion</li>
			<li>Splendor</li>
			<li>Spyfall</li>
			<li>Codenames</li>
		</ul>
